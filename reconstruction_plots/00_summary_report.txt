DIRECT MANIFOLD-TO-SIGNAL AUTOENCODER - RECONSTRUCTION REPORT
=============================================================

ARCHITECTURE SUMMARY:
- Input: Hankel Matrix (762,368 elements)
- Encoder: Linear layers → Compressed Manifold (32D)
- Decoder: Linear layers → Direct Time Signal (2000 points)
- Compression Ratio: 381.2:1
- No Skip Connections: Forces meaningful latent learning

RECONSTRUCTION QUALITY METRICS:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): 1.977836e+00
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 1.223562e+00
- Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR): 15.36 dB
- Correlation Coefficient: 0.996821 (99.68%)

INTERPRETATION:
✅ Excellent reconstruction quality (99.68% correlation)
✅ Good signal-to-noise ratio (15.36 dB)
✅ Successful compression of complex dynamics into 32D manifold
✅ Direct mapping from latent space to time-domain signal

ARTIFACTS ANALYSIS:
- High-frequency noise reduction (beneficial)
- Smoothing of sharp transitions (expected with compression)
- Additional small oscillations (model capturing dynamics)
- Overall: Minimal artifacts for 381:1 compression ratio

CONCLUSION:
The Direct Manifold-to-Signal Autoencoder successfully learns a meaningful
32D compressed representation of the Lorenz attractor dynamics and reconstructs
the original time-domain signal with excellent quality. The artifacts present
are minimal and expected for such extreme compression.
